---PHP Arma2 Server Status---

https://github.com/firefly2442/phparma2serverstatus

phparma2serverstatus queries an Arma2 server through PHP and displays information about the server
such as the map that is running, connected players, and other information.

Setup:

Run: git submodule update --init

This will grab the GameQ dependency submodule.

Edit the config.inc.php file and specify the IP addresses and ports for the servers you
want to query.  That's it.  Then just navigate to the page to see the results.
